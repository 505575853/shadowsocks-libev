# SSR libev

_Who will use this any more?_

## Disclaimers

This is my own modified version of shadowsocksR libev (client only). It is based on the [last official commit][last commit] of the original repo. This version is by no means a continuation of the original project, nor do I have any connection to it. It only contains some experimental code for my own use. I do not accept any pull requests in this repo. Please contribute to the [upstream project][upstream].

## Extra Features

### Code base cleaned up

* __libsodium support removed__, no NaCl cryptos
* [Embed mbedTLS][mbedtls] with AES hardware/assembly acceleration:
  * Hardware AES: Intel/ARM 64-bit on any OS, Intel 32-bit on Windows only
  * Assembly AES: ARM/MIPS 32-bit on Linux only, using assembly generated by OpenSSL project

### Better Windows support

* Backport upstream MinGW patches originally written by myself
* [IOCP-based libev][libev] backend powered by [wepoll][wepoll]
* TCP Fast Open support on Windows 10
* Support SIP003 multi-process plugin on Windows

### Simpler build using Docker

* Supported OS:
  * `docker/linux-mac` for Linux/macOS on 64-bit Intel
  * `docker/mingw` for Windows on 32/64-bit Intel
  * `docker/mingw-arm64` for Windows on 64-bit ARM (for future-proof, [tested on QEMU](arm.png))
* Support to build using Docker in a simple way:
  * Type `make` in the directory on Unix-like system
  * Double-click `make.bat` on Windows
* All generated executables are __fully portable__:
  * Statically linked with no dependency
  * Just copy the single executable file and run

### GoQuiet support

* [GoQuiet][goquiet] obfuscation protocol implemented as __native SSR obfs plugin__
* Usage:
    * `obfs` set to `go_quiet`
    * `obfs_param` set to the the server name you want to expose in TLS handshake (same as the original [`ServerName` option][gq-config] of GoQuiet)
    * Note that [`Key` option][gq-config] of GoQuiet client is __the same__ as `password` option in SSR and cannot be changed at the moment.
* Support to build using either the [C version][gq-c] (rewritten by myself, by default), or the original [Go version][gq-go] (enable by `--enable-golang` when running `configure`)

### Use other SIP003 plugins

* Use any compatible SIP003 plugins for obfuscation (e.g. [simple-obfs][simple-obfs], [GoQuiet][goquiet])
* Usage: [same][plugin usage] as original project by specifying `--plugin` and `--plugin-opts` in command-line options

### Run as SIP003 plugin

* Run as an SIP003 plugin to provide obfuscation service to other shadowsocks client
* No standalone mode, only accept [environmental variables][sip003] as configuration
* Usage: in other client specify the executable name as `plugin` and setup `plugin-opts` (required)
    * `obfs` is the obfuscation protocol, currently supported: all original SSR protocols (`http_simple, http_post, tls1.2_ticket_auth`) and GoQuiet (`go_quiet`)
    * `param` is the parameters for obfuscation. For SSR protocols, check the [original documents][ssrdoc]. For GoQuiet, `param` is the same as [`ServerName` option][gq-config].
    * `key` is only used for GoQuiet, which is the key for accessing server (same as [`Key` option][gq-config]).
* Example: run as a GoQuiet client plugin

        --plugin "ssr-local" --plugin-opts "obfs=go_quiet;param=bing.com;key=pass"

### New protocol

* `auth_aes128_fast`: similar to `auth_aes128_*`, but using a simple and fast [SipHash-1-3][siphash] to replace HMAC-MD5/SHA1. The speed is at least __2x faster__ than MD5 or SHA-1 hash. Note that the round is [reduced][rust-siphash] for better throughput while normal use is SipHash-2-4.
